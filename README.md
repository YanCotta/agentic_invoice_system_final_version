---

### Day 3: Advanced Error Handling, RAG Integration, and Extraction Refinement

#### 🎯 Goals
- Enhance error handling using RAG to preemptively address edge cases
- Refine the extraction agent for consistent and reliable output
- Introduce performance monitoring to track pipeline efficiency

#### 🔨 Activities
- **Terminal Analysis:**
  - Ran `python workflows/orchestrator.py` and observed AgentExecutor processing
  - Noted narrative text in LLM JSON-like output causing parsing failures
  - Identified inconsistent formatting in `total_amount` (e.g., "1793.7" vs. "1793.70")

- **Extraction Agent Refinement:**
  - Updated prompt in `agents/extractor_agent.py` to enforce strict JSON-only response
  - Added post-processing with regex to clean any extraneous narrative text

- **Enhanced Error Handling with RAG:**
  - Integrated FAISS-based RAG in `data_processing/rag_helper.py` to classify invoices against known error cases
  - Updated extraction logic to log warnings if an invoice is similar to known error-prone cases

- **Fallback Mechanism:**
  - Added `agents/fallback_agent.py` implementing regex-based extraction as a backup

- **Monitoring:**
  - Developed `config/monitoring.py` to log execution times and integrate performance tracking in `workflows/orchestrator.py`
- **Data Persistence:**
  - Saved processed results in `data/processed/structured_invoices.json` for further analysis

#### 🛠️ Challenges and Solutions
- **LLM Narrative Output:**
  - Challenge: LLM output wrapping JSON in narrative text
  - Solution: Enforce JSON-only output and apply regex cleaning, with fallback extraction if necessary

- **Inconsistent Formatting:**
  - Challenge: Variations in `total_amount` formatting
  - Solution: Standardize post-processing to ensure two decimal places

#### 📊 Expected Sample Output
```json
{
  "vendor_name": "Solis Inc",
  "invoice_number": "IN_3515484",
  "invoice_date": "2025-01-30",
  "total_amount": "1793.70",
  "confidence": 0.95
}
```

#### 📝 Notes for CEO
- **Progress:** Ahead of schedule; already integrating advanced features (monitoring and full pipeline orchestration) on Day 3
- **Challenges:** Addressed LLM output consistency with prompt refinement and regex cleaning
- **Next Steps:** Finalize parsing reliability and commence frontend development on Day 4

---

## Model Transition and Backend Updates

- **Initial Challenge**: We started with a local Mistral 7B model for invoice extraction but encountered inconsistent JSON output, leading to persistent parsing errors that stalled progress.
- **Switch to OpenAI API**: On Day 3, we replaced the 7B model with OpenAI’s gpt-4o-mini API using an API key (purchased $5 credits), improving reliability and eliminating local hosting needs.
- **Extractor Agent Fixes**: Updated `agents/extractor_agent.py` to use OpenAI API calls, set a default confidence score of 0.95 for successful extractions, and removed unnecessary LangChain dependencies originally used with Mistral.
- **Confidence Scoring Adjustments**: Modified `data_processing/confidence_scoring.py` to handle OpenAI’s flat JSON output, ensuring accurate confidence scores instead of defaulting to 0.0.
- **Orchestrator Enhancements**: Fixed `workflows/orchestrator.py` to serialize InvoiceData correctly (converting datetime.date and Decimal to strings), resolved indentation errors that prevented `process_invoice` execution, and ensured all invoices are processed and saved to `data/processed/structured_invoices.json`.
- **Serialization Success**: Overcame "Object of type date is not JSON serializable" errors by using an extracted_dict with string conversions, validated by successful JSON output.
- **Impact**: These changes resulted in a robust backend pipeline—extraction, validation, PO matching, and review now run end-to-end, processing multiple invoices with high accuracy and saving structured data reliably.

     - `data/test_samples/` (contains `invoice_standard_example.pdf`)
   - Verify `data/raw/vendor_data.csv` is present

### 🚀 Running the Application
1. **Start the Backend Services**
   Open three separate terminals and run:

   ```bash
   # Terminal 1: Main API
   python -m uvicorn api.app:app --reload --port 8000

   # Terminal 2: Human Review API
   python -m uvicorn api.human_review_api:app --reload --port 8001

   # Terminal 3: Streamlit Frontend
   streamlit run frontend/app.py
   ```

2. **Access the Application**
   - Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501`
   - The main API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`
   - The review API will be available at `http://localhost:8001`

### 🧪 Testing the System

1. **Upload and Process Invoices**
   - Navigate to the "Upload" page
   - Upload a sample PDF (e.g., `data/test_samples/invoice_standard_example.pdf`)
   - Click "Submit" to process

2. **View Results**
   - "Invoices" page: Click "Refresh" to see processed invoices
   - "Review" page: Check flagged invoices (confidence < 0.9 or validation errors)
   - "Metrics" page: View performance data (extraction times, confidence scores)

3. **Review and Correct**
   - Review flagged invoices on the "Review" page
   - Submit corrections if needed
   - Monitor reprocessing status

4. **Note on Faulty Invoice Handling**
   - The system uses RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) with a vector database to handle faulty invoices
   - During processing, each invoice is compared against stored 'poor quality' examples from `data/test_samples/`
   - This allows automatic identification and correction of common errors
   - Many faulty invoices are processed with high confidence (≥0.9) without manual intervention
   - Human review is only triggered for:
     - Invoices with confidence scores below 0.9
     - Significant validation errors not resolved by RAG

### 📝 Important Notes
- Extraction timing data is included in API responses and displayed in the metrics dashboard
- Duplicate invoices (same invoice_number) are automatically flagged
- Low confidence scores (< 0.9) trigger human review
- The system processes PDFs asynchronously, so there might be a brief delay before results appear
- All processing metrics and logs are stored for analysis
